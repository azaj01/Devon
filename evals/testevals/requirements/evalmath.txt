    The CLI application is a simple command-line tool that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. It accepts three command-line arguments: the operation to be performed (either "add" or "multiply"), the first number, and the second number. The application should handle these arguments correctly and perform the specified operation on the provided numbers. For the "add" operation, the application should add the two numbers together and display the result. Similarly, for the "multiply" operation, it should multiply the two numbers and display the result. The application should handle invalid operations gracefully by raising an exception or displaying an appropriate error message. The numbers provided as arguments should be parsed as integers. The application should be implemented in Python and should be executable from the command line using the python command followed by the script name and the required arguments. The result format is "Result: <result/>" where <result/> is the result of the operation. The python file should be named "evalmath.py".
